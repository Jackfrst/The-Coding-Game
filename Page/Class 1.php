        </center>
        <p>
            Cows are <mark> 4 leged </mark> animals that are herbivorous.<u>They feed on plants</u>. They are big animals that can reach a height of 3-4 feet. We get plenty of food products from cows like milk, cheese, yogurt, fat, etc. <i>They are mammals who give birth to young ones.</i> The babies of cows are known as calves. There are many varieties of cows; some of them have white, plain skin, while others have a spotted body. Most of the cows have thick coats that are 4-layers deep. <em>Cows are of great importance to man</em>. We are dependent on them for plenty of products without which we cannot imagine our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>--The cowman.</strong>
